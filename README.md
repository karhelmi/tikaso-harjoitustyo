# Tietokantasovellus / Database application (period 1, fall 2021)

## Status

I have started planning this application on 10 Sep 2021 and the final delivery date is on 24 October 2021. There are two intermediate releases before the final
delivery date.

The current status is that I am planning the type of application that I want to build. No development work has been done yet. I am not sure whether this plan is too extensive for me for this course as I have no previous experience from PostreSQL or Flask library.

## Subject of the Project

The application should be a web-based application that uses PostreSQL database and Python Flask library. The application should contain 5-10 tables.

The purpose of the application is to support the company in product improvement by having related information available in the application and also to provide a platform for
users to share their ideas for Product improvement.

## Key Functions of the Application
One role to start with: normal user

1. A user can create a new username and password.
1. A user can login and logout.
1. A user sees a list of Products after login (+ since when or until when the Product has been part of the company's selection).
1. A user can add a new Product or remove and existing Product from the list.
